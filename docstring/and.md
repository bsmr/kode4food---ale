Evaluates the forms from left to right. As soon as one evaluates to a falsey value, will return that value. Otherwise it will proceed to evaluating the next form.

#### An Example

~~~scheme
(and (+ 1 2 3)
     false
     "not returned")
~~~

Will return _#f_ (false), never evaluating _"not returned"_, whereas:

~~~scheme
(and (+ 1 2 3)
     true
     "returned")
~~~

Will return the string _"returned"_.
