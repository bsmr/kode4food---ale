Will bind a macro to a global name. A macro is expanded by the reader in order to alter the source code's data representation before it is evaluated.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define-macro (cond . clauses)
  (when (seq clauses)
    (if (= 1 (length clauses))
      (clauses 0)
      (list 'ale/if
        (clauses 0) (clauses 1)
        (cons 'cond (rest (rest clauses)))))))
```
