Returns a new Function whose initial arguments are pre-bound to those provided. When that Function is invoked, any provided arguments will simply be appended to the pre-bound arguments before calling the original Function.

#### An Example

```scheme
(define plus10 (partial + 4 6))
(plus10 9)
```

This example will return _19_ as though `(+ 4 6 9)` were called.
