Forward declares bindings. This means that the names will be known in the current namespace, but not yet assigned. This can be useful when two functions refer to one another.

#### An Example

```scheme
(declare is-odd-number)

(define (is-even-number n)
  (cond [(= n 0) true]
        [:else   (is-odd-number (- n 1))]))

(define (is-odd-number n)
  (cond [(= n 0) false]
        [:else   (is-even-number (- n 1))]))
```
